# The Page Turner Project

This project's goal is to assits readers across the globe stay on track with their reading goals while keeping statistics on what they read. This app has several main components which include Goals, Metrics and Bookcases.

## Goals

Users can set goals for themselves with the Page Turner App such as "I want to read 10 books this year" or "I want to finish this book in 7 days". These goals are broken into two main categories: Timeline Reading and Streamlined Reading. Streamlined reading allows the user to select a book from their shelf with a goal to complete the read in a designated amount of time. Meanwhile, Timeline Reading can be for more broad goals such as wanting to read a certain number of books or pages in a month or a year.

## Metrics

Based on the user's completed reads, The Page Turner App will be able to calculate fun statistics to encourage readers to continue doing what they love... Reading! As the user logs their most recent book, the number of pages, author, genre and other details will be pulled from the book to be used to calculate monthly and yearly statistics that may encourage readers to choose bigger books, different genres, and set new goals for themselves based on their metrics.

## Bookcases

Bookcases are simply collections of books defined by the user. These bookcases are named and managed by the user. When a book is pulled off of the shelf it will enter a designated "Currently Reading" bookcase and a "Completed Reads" bookcase when the reader has finished a book. This allows the user to go back and find details about current and past books.

## Applications

The Page Turner App has the potential tp be used for pleasure by avid readers as well as encouraging new readers to get excited about reading!
